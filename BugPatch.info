This document will just document the methods of every bugfix I have included so far.
Tewak = Disabled by default, for my personal preferential use.

ArrowFix
- A field was set incorrectly in EntityArrow's onUpdate() method,
- This led to the algorithm that determines whether the arrow should impact a block to break
- As such, the arrow believed it was in a different block than it actually was, causing dupe and transmutation glitches.
- This is fixed by changing the field assignment back to what it was in 1.6.4.
- This bug was also fixed by Mojang in 1.7.6

ArrowDingTweak
- I wanted to know whether I had hit a mob from far away, so I took EntityArrow's onUpdate() once more and changed the "ding" check to include IMob implementations as well as players.

ChatOpacityFix
- Since 1.7.x, chat opacity slider controlled only the gray background opacity and not the actual words.
- This adds a GL11.glEnable(GL11.GL_BLEND) that was present in 1.6.4
- This fix has been pulled into MinecraftForge 1181+ and Minecraft 1.8

ChickenLureFix
- There was an inconsistency: chickens could breed with all subclasses of ItemSeeds
- This adds AI tasks that make chickens attracted to all items they can breed with, not just seeds.

HeartFlashFix
- Since 1.0.0 SMP and 1.3.1 SSP, the hearts no longer flashed the "delta" health, or damage taken.
- In the past, if one were at 10 hearts and dropped to 5, the 5 lost hearts would flash white to indicate their loss.
- This readds that functionality which was inadvertently removed due to the clientside value the renderer depended on no longer being updated properly.
- Works in 1.8 but not exactly as before :/

HeartBlinkFix
- The DataWatcher holds the health.
- The client player's setPlayerSPHealth() method is called by a health update packet, which queues a new health value to the clientside datawatcher
- The client datawatcher is *actually* updated with the server value in a separate entity metadata packet.
- The game does the blink on regen by setting the client player's hurtResistantTime to 10.
- However the time is set in the health update packet, but the actual new health does not actually arrive until the next packet.
- So by the time the renderer notices, hurtResistantTime is already 8 or 9 and thus the renderer renders no blink
- Fix: Set hurtResistantTime to 11, gives an extra tick for the entity metadata packet to arrive and be processed
- Works in 1.8 but not exactly as before :/

ItemHopperBounceFix
- Items no longer bounce around on locked hoppers

ItemStairBounceFix
- Items no longer bounce around on stairs.
- Super annoying bug for me but some like it, so it is disabled by default

SnowballFix
- All projectiles that deal 0 damage knock back players again.

ToolDesyncFix
- Tools are only damaged on the server side so discrepancies in calculating the Unbreaking enchantment do not cause reappearing tools

VillageAnvilTweak
- Blacksmith houses generate with an anvil where there was a double stone slab (which was supposed to be an "anvil" anyway).

XPFix
- XP Orbs were being spawned on the clientside 32x their true coordinates, leading them to be invisible for several seconds after spawning
- This restores proper functionality, last shown in Minecraft 1.4.7.
- This fix has been pulled into MinecraftForge 1182+
